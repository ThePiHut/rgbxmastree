Code examples for the RGB Xmas Tree

## Getting started

Start by downloading the xmas tree file. Open a terminal and type:

```bash
wget https://bit.ly/2Lr9CT3 -O tree.py
```

When you write your own Python code, make sure you keep this file in the same
folder.

Open a Python shell or IDE (like Mu, Thonny or IDLE) and import `RGBXmasTree`:

```python
from tree import RGBXmasTree
```

Initialise your tree:

```python
from tree import RGBXmasTree

tree = RGBXmasTree()
```

## Change the brightness

You can change the brightness from 0 to 1 - the default is 0.5:

```python
from tree import RGBXmasTree

tree.brightness=0.1
```

You'll find that 1 is _extremely bright_ and even 0.1 is plenty bright enough if
the tree is on your desk :)

## Change the colour

You can set the colour of all the LEDs together using RGB values (all 0-1):

```python
from tree import RGBXmasTree

tree = RGBXmasTree()

tree.color = (1, 0, 0)
```

Alternatively you can use the `colorzero` library:

```python
from tree import RGBXmasTree
from colorzero import Color

tree = RGBXmasTree()

tree.color = Color('red')
```

You can write a loop to repeatedly cycle through red, green and blue:

```python
from tree import RGBXmasTree
from time import sleep

tree = RGBXmasTree()

colors = [(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)]

for color in colors:
    tree.color = color
    sleep(1)
```

## Individual control

You can also control each LED individually, for example turn each one red, one
at a time:

```python
from tree import RGBXmasTree
from time import sleep

tree = RGBXmasTree()

for pixel in tree:
    pixel.color = (1, 0, 0)
    sleep(1)
```

To control a specific pixel, you can access it by its index number (0-24):

```python
tree[0].color = (0, 1, 0)
```

## Examples

## RGB cycle

Cycle through red, green and blue, changing all pixels together

- [rgb.py](examples/rgb.py)

### One-by-one

Cycle through red, green and blue, changing pixel-by-pixel

- [onebyone.py](examples/onebyone.py)

### Hue cycle

Cycle through hues forever

- [huecycle.py](examples/huecycle.py)

### Random sparkles

Randomly sparkle all the pixels

- [randomsparkles.py](examples/randomsparkles.py)
